# ROS Basics
This repository acts as my note pad as I learn ROS basics, motion and OpenCV.

## Learning Outcomes 
* Understand **ROS ecosystems**- Topics, nodes, messages, services, actionlib 
* Understand how position and orientation are represented in ROS
* Develop simple **computer vision programs** with ROS and **OpenCV**
    * Pixels and image structure (python)
    * Image encoding (python)
    * Video streams input (python)
    * Drawing shapes
    * Integrating OpenCV and ROS
    * Adaptive thresholding
    * Color filtering
    * Contours detection and processing
* Develop simple application to control **robot motion**
* Learn how to structure a C++/Python ROS project
